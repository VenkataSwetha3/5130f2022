In our project, we designed the face of the website, including the Homepage, CookBook, and a "Crave Quiz" for the user to take part in so that they could decide which food to eat based on a simple breakdown of their cravings, an About section and Contact Us section.
We still have to work on:- which recipes to include on our website, i.e., the CookBook, Crave quiz, and any additional developments that would make the website even better.
The Crave Quiz would include some basic info about the user and filters that would help the user decide which kind of food they want to eat at the moment based on their cravings.

The project is still at an elementary level, and we, as a group, are proud of the knowledge we acquired when we researched why and how cravings are generated, and how to control them; what pregnant women go through during their pregnancy; because learning and understanding the necessity of a healthy diet and a happy mind is essential. 

This week we worked on the database that is required for the crave quiz. We are collecting all possible inputs that could help generate better meal suggestion outputs. We plan on asking few questions to know about users' cravings through the quiz. We also plan on collecting demographical data like age, body height & weight, presence of menstrual cramps and stress and any other menstrual cycle related symptoms that affect the mood and generate emotions. In the coming week, we are going to work on suggesting few recipies based on users' responses, and add all the meal recipes, that the quiz is required to suggest to the COOKBOOK.
