In our project, we designed the face of the website, including the Homepage, CookBook, About, and Filters page for the user to choose from so that they could decide which food to eat based on a simple breakdown of their cravings, as well as Contact page.
We still have to work on:- which recipes to include on our website, i.e., the CookBook, and any additional developments that would make the website even better.
The Filters would include some categories to choose from, like the main categories being breakfast, lunch, dinner, and beverages; while the sub-categories would be meal types like vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, etc., that would help the user decide which kind of food they want to eat at the moment based on their cravings.

The project is still at an elementary level, and we, as a group, are proud of the knowledge we acquired when we researched why and how cravings are generated, and how to control them; what pregnant women go through during their pregnancy; because learning and understanding the necessity of a healthy diet and a happy mind is essential. 

This week we worked on the database that is required for the Filters and CookBook. We are collecting all possible inputs that could help generate better meal suggestion outputs. By the submission date, our website should be up and running.
