	<p style = "border:black; border-style:dotted;">I am Venkata Swetha Punati. I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at <em>University of Massachusetts,Lowell</em>. My hobbies are watching cricket, playing batminton, watching movies, hanging out with friends. I would like to share about one of my projects that I have done during my undergraduation that is <em>PATIENT HEALTH REPORTING SYSTEM</em>. My project is mainly to help the patients who were unable to move from their place when they require any help. Different health parameters of a person are monitoried continuously and whenever patient need any help they can place their finger on sensor so that desired care taker will be notified by saying 'HELP NEEDED'. With this many old and disabled people can lead happy life. </p>
