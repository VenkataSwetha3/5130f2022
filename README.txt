                                            PROJECT PROPOSAL

PROJECT TITLE : Regulating Food Cravings using Filters.
ABSTRACT:  
We wish to make a website or an app that acts as a simulator to help women all over the world get a better food suggestion for the kind of cravings they have during pregnancy and/or monthly menstrual cycle. We plan on doing so with the help of few filters like Mood of the user (happy, sad, angry, etc.), A list of human tastes that they feel like eating in the moment (sweet, sour, tangy, etc.), Choice of food (veg, non-veg, vegan), Meal of the day (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner), Time taken to prepare the dish (under 15 mins, under 30 mins) and we wish to include as many filters as possible for successful results of food recipe suggestions. The aim of this app or website is to help women eat what they crave while maintaining their health. So, the suggestions would also include the calories count of each item in the recipe or the overall recipe, so that all the women around the world need not stress over over-eating and stay healthy.
 
INTERFACE: 
In this project our Interface Includes Homepage, Description about the website, Services provided and we also might Include Crave quiz which acts as a simulator to suggest different kinds of Food recipes for the kind of cravings they have depending on their mood. It also includes filters which can provide additional information and can have a track of their health and diet plan. We further add various resources  for our project as needed.

DATASETS:   
In this project we are going to use one of the four different types of datasets to test and train and to modify our app/website by including various resources.
1. Current  Class 1 - Class 4 Food Establishments:
     Class I is a food service establishment with commercially prepackaged foods and/or hot or cold beverages only. No preparation, cooking or hot holding of potentially hazardous foods is included except that commercially packaged precooked foods may be heated and served in the original package within four hours. 
     Class IV is a food service establishment having on the premises exposed potentially hazardous foods that are prepared by hot processes and held for more than four hours prior to consumption by the public. 
     
     
 
2. Food Nutritional Values:
       It provides the foundation for most food composition databases in the public and private sectors. It contains data on 8,789 food items and upto 150 food components. It retrives Nutritional values from the USDA National Nutrient Database. 

3. Food Related Words:
       In this dataset we relate 7000 words that relate to food items, cooking, ingredients, groceries, markets, etc. It contains common English nouns as well. These can be easily sorted out.
4. Discover the Menu:
       This dataset includes 45,000 menus from the 1840s to the present.  It includes restaurant menus, dish by dish, so that they can be searched easily.  On the menu there will be mix of simple bibiliographic description and the culinary and economic content of the menus.
