OSI MODEL

Abstract:
                  The OSI model was published by International Organization for Standardization in 1984. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. This model is useful to develop communication from one computer to another computer over a network. Protecting data over the network has become the major issue as the amount of information passing through the information system networks is increasing every day. OSI model provides information security. 

                 The OSI model breaks the communication system into seven layers: Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session layer, Presentation Layer and Application layers. In which, Data Link Layer has two sublayers which are Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).  Application layer has two sublayers which are Common Application Service Element (CASE) and Specific Application Service Element (SASE).  Every layer has its own functions that make sure of providing high security.

                  Each layer provides a different and additional protection to provide solutions and prevention to security issues and risks associated with manipulation, data intervention, destruction. OSI model is the first standard model for network communications and got adopted by major computer and telecommunication companies. This model reduces complications and standardizes interfaces. Itâ€™s a long process to fit protocol. We have way more advantages from OSI model than we assume. 

             Technology vendors and developers mostly uses the OSI model. The main purpose of OSI reference model is to promote a clear framework that describes the functions of networking or telecommunications system. OSI model plays a major role in security issues and provides solutions.
